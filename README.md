Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classifier

Overview
This repository contains the source code for a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: normal and pneumonia. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and is trained on the Chest X-Ray Images dataset.

Features
Train a CNN model to classify chest X-ray images.
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics.
Preprocessing scripts for data augmentation and normalization.
Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Chest X-Ray Images dataset, which can be found in the file itself. The dataset contains X-ray images labeled as normal or pneumonia.

Requirements
Python 3.x
